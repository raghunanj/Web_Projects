1. Side effect is that when a huge calculation is performed the animation stops
2. Here instead of calculation i have used sleep
		Thing to keep in mind is that sleep is not an inbuilt function
		and i have implemented it myself
		
3. If by chance examiner do not agree with the sleep thing than i have also implemented a factorial function	
		But since its just to demonstrate obviously they will agree with sleep thing
		
4. Click on compute button to see the side effect

5. a) page1.html shows the side effect
   b) page2.html shows its solution
